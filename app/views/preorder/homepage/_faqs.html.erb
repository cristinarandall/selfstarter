          <p>You'll need to <a href="https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/accountstatus">create an Amazon Seller Central account</a>. Afterwards, get your access key and secret key from the "Integration" tab on your AWS account. <a href="https://payments.amazon.com/sdui/sdui/helpTab/Checkout-by-Amazon/Advanced-Integration-Help/Using-Your-Access-Key">Click here for more info</a>.

What is Ambient Sound?</summary>
          <p>
Ambient sound is the sound that we hear all around us (when we don't plug our ears with normal earbuds). That might be friends talking to us, phones ringing, footsteps, etc. It might also include trucks speeding up behind your bycicle or muggers racing up to grab your laptop bag. It can also include more offensive noises like the drone of airplane cabin or a jackhammer in the street.

          <summary>How does it work? </summary>
          <p>

With normal noise isolating earphones the earbud has a good seal into the ear, which is how a tiny speaker can produce high quality sound. But a byproduct is that ambient sound is blocked out. We believe that being able to hear the world around you is as important as good sound quality, so we set out to design earphones that provide great sound quality but still let you hear ambient sounds. We do this by designing very high quality earbuds with powerful, full range speakers (we call them drivers) and excellent in-ear sealing.

          <summary>Why did you release this?</summary>
          <p>Hardware startups are less welcome on Kickstarter than they were 6 months ago. We needed to roll our own kickstarter, so we did. Other hardware startups probably will too, so we made it easier for them by open sourcing our way of doing it.</p>

          <summary class=''>What software stack does this use?</summary>
          <p>It's a Ruby on Rails app that makes heavy use of SCSS, Kickstarter's wonderful <code>amazon_flex_pay</code> gem, and a hint of CoffeeScript.</p>
